Hi, I am Felix and am a master's student in the [RADMEP](https://master-radmep.org) programme. I am a physicist in the midst of transitioning into a photonics engineer. My research interests are: photonic integrated circuit (PIC) and PIC integration with CMOS technology. Currently doing a summer internship in David Marpaung's [Nonlinear Nanophotonics (NLNP)](https://davidmarpaung.com/) research group at the University of Twente.

I acquired my bachelor's degree of physics from [Institut Teknologi Bandung](https://fi.itb.ac.id/).

This page will be updated with more exciting stuff soon!
